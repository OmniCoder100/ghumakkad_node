Title: My Amritsar Plan for the Soul! 🙏✨

Waheguru! 🙏 Amritsar is just... pure magic! The vibe here is something else, full spiritual feels!

First, the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib). My tip? Go at night! 🌃 The reflection in the water is... uff! 💖 It's so peaceful. Aur langar zaroor khana. Sitting and eating with everyone... it's the most humbling experience.

Next, Jallianwala Bagh. It's right next door. It's a very important place in our history, makes you feel so many emotions. 🇮🇳

My Secret Tip: You have to go to the Wagah Border ceremony in the evening! 🫡 The energy is INSANE! Full desh-bhakti (patriotism) vibes! And for food... forget everything and go to 'Kesar Da Dhaba'. Wahan ka Dal Makhani aur Paratha... full food coma! 🤤
