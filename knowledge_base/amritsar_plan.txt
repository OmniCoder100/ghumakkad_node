 Title:My Amritsar Plan for the Soul! 🙏✨

Waheguru! 🙏
Amritsar is pure magic! The energy here hits different — full of spiritual vibes, food love, and desi pride! 🇮🇳

🌟 1. The Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib)

The heart of Amritsar — peaceful, glowing, and divine!
My Tip: Go at night 🌃 — the reflection of the gold in the sarovar (holy pond) is mesmerizing! ✨

🍽️ Don’t miss the Langar — it’s free for everyone, 24×7, and the experience of sitting with hundreds of people from all walks of life… truly humbling.

🕰️ Timings: Open 24 hours
💸 Entry: Free
📍 Location: Golden Temple Road, Amritsar

🇮🇳 2. Jallianwala Bagh

Just a short walk from the Golden Temple — this is where history gives you goosebumps.
You can still see bullet marks on the walls — a strong reminder of our freedom struggle.

🕰️ Timings: 6:30 AM – 7:30 PM
💸 Entry: Free
📍 Location: Golden Temple Rd, Near Hall Bazaar, Amritsar

🫡 3. Wagah Border Ceremony

This is where your heart will go “Bharat Mata Ki Jai!” 💪
The energy here is next-level — cheering, music, and full patriotic goosebumps!

🕰️ Timings:

Summer: 5:15 PM

Winter: 4:15 PM
💸 Entry: Free (reach early for seats!)
📍 Location: 30 km from Amritsar city (Attari-Wagah Road)
🚕 Tip: Leave the city around 2:30 PM to avoid traffic and get good seats.

🍛 4. Kesar Da Dhaba (Legendary Taste Since 1916)

Forget everything — just eat here!
Their Dal Makhani, Chana, and Parathas will make you forget the world. 😋

Giani Tea Stall (Cooper Rd): Their chai is legendary — ₹25/cup, served with pakoras in the morning!

🧿 8. Shopping & Street Food Vibes

After all the darshan and food coma, go for a local walk!
