Title: Varanasi - My Guide to the Soul of India! ✨

Varanasi (ya Kashi!) is... timeless! ⏳ It's intense, full of life, and just... magical. It's an experience, not just a trip!

Number 1 Thing: Subah-subah (like 5 AM!) boat ride on the Ganga. ⛵️ Watching the sunrise and all the ghats come to life... it's a life-changing moment. Seriously!

Number 2 Thing: The evening Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat. It's SO powerful! The music, the fire, the energy... goosebumps! 🔥 Be wahan early to get a good spot (or watch from a boat!).

My Secret Foodie Tip: Lassi! 🤤 'Blue Lassi Shop' (near the main ghat) is super famous and has like 100 flavours! And agar winters mein jaa rahe ho, you MUST try 'Malaiyyo' (makhan malai). It's like eating a sweet, saffron-flavoured cloud! ☁️
