Title: My Lucknow Plan: Full Nawabi Style! 😌👑

Aadaab! 😌 Lucknow is all about tehzeeb (manners), nazaakat (grace), and... KEBABS! 🤤 It's a city that's full of history and amazing food!

Must-Visit: The Bara Imambara. It's so grand! Wahan ka Bhulbhulaiya (the labyrinth) is so much fun! 🌀 Try not to get lost... hehe! 😜 The architecture is just... wow!

Must-See: The Rumi Darwaza. It's the logo of the city! It's right near the Imambara. Perfect photo spot! 📸

My Foodie Secret (This is the most important part!): KEBABS! 🤤 Go to 'Tunday Kababi' in Aminabad for their Galouti Kebabs. They literally melt in your mouth. Aur shaam ko, go to 'Sharma Ji Ki Chai' in Hazratganj for the best chai and a 'samosa-bun' (yes, it's a thing!). Haye! 😍
