Title: Coimbatore - My Fave Nature Escape! 🌿🧘

Coimbatore is sooo underrated! It's not just a "textile city"... for me, it's all about nature and peace! 😌

The BEST thing to do: Visit the Adiyogi Shiva Statue at the Isha Yoga Center. 🧘 It is MASSIVE! 😱 The largest bust sculpture in the world! It's so, so peaceful, especially in the evening. Full spiritual recharge.

For adventure lovers: Go to the Siruvani Waterfalls. 💧 Wahan pe thoda trek karna padta hai, but the water is said to be the sweetest in India! Full jungle vibes! 🌳

My Fave Foodie Tip: You CANNOT miss breakfast at 'Annapoorna'. 🥞 Unka Ghee Roast Dosa aur filter coffee... ☕️ uff! It's the perfect South Indian breakfast to start your day!
