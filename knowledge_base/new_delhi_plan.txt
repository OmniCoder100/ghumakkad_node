Title: Delhi, Dilwalon ki Dilli! ❤️ My Perfect Day!

Delhi! It's not just politics, it's... everything! 🤩 History, food, shopping... my head spins (in a good way! 😜).

Here's my perfect "Dilli-Dil-Khush" day:

Morning: Start at Humayun's Tomb. It's like a mini, super-chill Taj Mahal. 🕌 So beautiful and perfect for a winter morning walk.

Afternoon: Shopping! 🛍️ Agar bargaining kar sakte ho, go to Sarojini Nagar! (Hehe 😜). If you want to be more fancy, my fave is Khan Market. Wahan pe 'Big Chill Cakery' ka Blueberry Cheesecake try karna... O.M.G. 🍰

Evening: Hauz Khas Village! 🌅 It's full of cute cafes and you get the BEST sunset view over the lake. Full artsy vibes!

My Foodie Secret: Forget fancy restaurants. Go to 'Karim's' near Jama Masjid for the best non-veg, or 'Paranthe Wali Gali' in Chandni Chowk for... well... paranthe! 🤤
