Title: Puri = Beach + Blessings! My Fave Combo! 🌊🙏

I love Puri! It's the perfect combo of spiritual vibes and beachy fun! 🕉️🏖️

First, of course, the Jagannath Temple. It's one of the Char Dhams! The energy inside is... something else! It's huge and full of history.

Then, chill time! Go to the Golden Beach. It's a Blue Flag beach, matlab it's super clean and beautiful. 🌊 Just sit and watch the waves. It's so relaxing.

My Secret Tip: Don't miss the 'Mahaprasad' from the temple. It's food cooked for thousands of people and it just tastes... divine! 😋 Also, take a short trip to the Konark Sun Temple. It's not far, and the stone carving work is... mind-blowing! 🤯
