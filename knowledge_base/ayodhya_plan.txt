Title: My Divine Ayodhya Trip! 🙏🕉️

Jai Shri Ram! 🙏 Ayodhya is... so divine! You can just feel the peace and devotion in the air. It's a special, special place. 💖

Must-Do: The Ram Mandir, of course! 🤩 It's just... breathtaking. Itna grand aur beautiful. Words can't describe it, you have to see it! Wahan pe thoda time spend karna, just sit and feel the vibes.

Evening Plan: Go to Saryu River for the evening aarti. 🌇 The diyas floating on the river... it's pure magic! ✨ So peaceful and a perfect end to the day.

My Secret Tip: Hanumangarhi zaroor jaana! It's a beautiful temple (aur kehte hain Ram Mandir se pehle yahan darshan karna chahiye!). Wahan ke 'besan ke laddoo' as prasad... yummm! 😋
