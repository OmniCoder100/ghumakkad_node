Title: 2 Days in Jaipur - The Pink City Princess Plan! 👑

Jaipur! The Pink City! 🌸 Aise lagta hai main princess hoon! 👑 Okay, here is my perfect 2-day royal tour.

Day 1: The City Vibe
Start early and go straight to Hawa Mahal (hello, perfect Insta pic! 📸). Usko bahar se dekho, phir walk to the City Palace. It's HUGE and so, so royal! 💖 Wahan pe hi Jantar Mantar hai, woh bhi dekhlo... it's like a giant, ancient science park! 🔭

Day 2: The Forts!
This is the best day! Go to Amer Fort (or Amber Fort, same thing!). It's a bit outside the city, but it's the best part. Wahan pe elephant ride mat karna... please walk or take a jeep, it's prettier and better for the elephants. 🐘❤️ Upar se view is... wow! Wapas aate time, Jal Mahal (the water palace) pe rukh ke photo zaroor lena! 💧

My fave foodie secret: 'Rawat Misthan Bhandar' near the station. Unki Pyaaz Kachori is... to die for! 🤤 It's the best breakfast in the world! Garam garam khana!
